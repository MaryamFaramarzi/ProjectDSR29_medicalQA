      "Answer:\n",
      "natural complexion is the best. cosmetics do more harm than good. you can avoid them. melanin pigment in the skin protects against cancers. presence of more melanin in the skin gives the dark complexion. you can use sunscreen lotions which help in preventing tan due to sun. there are mild peeling agents with salicylic acid used in skin peel treatment. to discuss regarding the skin peel treatment consult a dermatologist online --> <link>\n",

      "Answer:\n",
      "both carbamazepine and flunarizine have side effect of memory loss. you should take tablet vasograin. it is most effective at the onset of migraine. once migraine starts though it reduces some symptoms but not so effectively. so along with it take tablet diclomol (combination of diclofenac and paracetamol) twice a day for three days. it is very effective to control migraine. if headache is very severe you can also take injection voveran intramuscularly. you also need to take tablet razo (rabeprazole) 20 mg twice a day to prevent acidity. for further information consult a neurologist online --> <link>\n",

      "Question 5:\n",
      "i am planing to go for liposuction for weight loss. my weight is 78kgs\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "your bmi - body mass index is 30. 4 kg/m2. generally we perform bariatric surgery to achieve permanent weight loss for any patient whose bmi is 30 kg/m2 or above. liposuction is not a treatment option for weight loss. it is a cosmetic procedure for body shaping. there is a set point for fat storage for everyone. this is not altered by liposuction. weight loss by liposuction diet control exercise naturopathy amway herbalife etc. is temporary as all these methods do not have any effect on set point for fat storage. so any fat that is removed in liposuction will reaccumulate over a period of 6 months to two years. those who can reduce weight by diet control and exercise does not need liposuction and those who cannot reduce weight by above methods will not reduce even after liposuction. bariatric surgery provides permanent weight loss as it lowers set point for fat storage. if you are looking for permanent weight loss then bariatric surgery is the only scientifically proven method for that. for further information consult a general surgeon online --> <link>\n",

      "hi i am sudarshan. i am a cp child(spastic diplegia). i have completed my computer engg from pune university and currently pursuing mba. i wish to learn driving? i have been practising for 6 months with vain. these are the problems that i face: 1. there is difficulty in releasing the clutch and pressing the accelerator at the same time. 2. the gear handling is also difficult with steering. 3. thirdly i have a somewhat poor road sense. how these can be improved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "cerebral palsy is a condition in which certain of the muscles (most often in the extremities) are affected thus causing muscle weakness up to paralysis. this might cause a disability of a certain degree in the person which would interfere in the everyday life driving ability included. however there are many car modifications that might help people with a driving disability. in the beginning it might be best to visit a doctor who might be able to determine the degree of disability and the modifications needed. in different countries there are associations that try to improve the life of people with disabilities. they also organize driver rehabilitation programs run by driver rehabilitation specialists. you might want to check if there is such an association in your country. they also might be able to tell you about legal issues related to drivers with disabilities. as for the problems you are experiencing (difficulty in releasing the clutch and pressing the accelerator at the same time; the gear handling is also difficult with steering) it might be easily solved if you buy a car with an automatic transmission. this would eliminate the need for a clutch and a manual shift. the problem with the poor road sense might need training from a driving rehabilitation specialist.\n",

      "this can be worse seems like depression which many people develop when they loose loved one or close friend. you can take help of psychiatric and psychologist but most importantly you have to help your self indulge your self in activities that you like that pleases you adopt hobbies. you can take help of close friends and family and they should understand emotions you are dealing. you have to understand that fact and accept the reality that no one has ability to control everything in their lives tough times do come but you have to deal with it because in other case its you that is suffering and hurting. take care of your self hope it helps thanks\n",

      "i just recently got a new tattoo on the back of my neck. right away i had this bump that was small in my tattoo. now its a month later and the hard bump is getting bigger and almost painful to touch it. theres no fluid or anything coming out. i am nervous what do i do?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "you seem concerned by the bump on tattoo immediately after getting the tattoo done which is persisting even after 1 month and getting harder bigger and painful. tattoos breach the skin which means that skin infections and other complications are possible. sometimes bumps called granulomas form around tattoo ink â especially red ink. tattooing can also lead to raised areas caused by an overgrowth of scar tissue (keloids). this might be the case with you and you must consult a dermatologist for the definitive diagnosis and management as the same is not possible online. hope this helps. take care. note: this post is not to emphasise final diagnosis as the same cannot be made online and is aimed just to provide medical information and no treatment suggested above be taken without face to face consultation with health care professional.\n",

      "I am a 21 y/o Chinese female, 5'4 and 115 pounds. I usually drink once or twice every week, but heavily when I do. Lots of shots. I am NOT an alcoholic. I don't crave alcohol, and I actually HATE the taste of it, even wine. I just drink to have fun and socialize.\n",

My friends have normal conversations with me and are SHOCKED when I tell them I don't remember anything the next day. I go from being tipsy to just waking up and wondering what happened, even though I do nothing crazy. There's no in between.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm wondering if this is an alcohol allergy. But, I can drink A LOT and my body seems fine. I can outdrink many guys and within a night, I could finish one bottle of whiskey to myself if I wanted to (I don't do that, don't worry). I'm known to be 'the last man standing'. In so many years, I have NEVER vomited involuntarily from being drunk, only forcefully to make myself feel better.Only problem is every time I sleep, I'd forget everything the next morning. There's just one last memory of being tipsy, not even DRUNK. \n",

      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "Does it hurt at any specific point in your chest if you push down? If so it could be costochondritis. You may have had a panic attack secondary to this unusual pain. It is an inflammation of the muscles between the ribs. If your EKG was ok, I’m inclined to say it’s not something more serious, but I would follow up with your doctor for more EKGs to make sure. Doctors can read EKGs wrong. ,As long as anxiety lingers chest pains can happen I believe. But I honestly can’t say for sure I’m not a psychiatrist yet. \n",

      "\n",
      "**Demographics**: 28/f/Caucasian \n",
      "\n",
      "**Current meds**: geodon 20mg BID, started 5/21\n",
      "\n",
      "**CC**: RLS-type symptoms; compulsion to move legs, emotional and physical distress when attempting to rest legs; worsens at night \n",
      "\n",
      "I recently started Geodon about a month ago. For the last two weeks I've been experiencing what I can only describe as RLS-type symptoms. I'm constantly needing to move my legs. If I try and calm myself and keep my legs still, I begin to get a strange sensation (diffuse, whole-limb tingling; very different from sciatica, doesn't run along one nerve in particular) and the effort it takes to resist the urge to move them is frustrating. These symptoms worsen at night, to the point where falling asleep is nearly impossible. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing I can come up with is that this might be a side effect of the Geodon, as it's the only new factor I can come up with (no change in other meds, diet, exercise, stress levels, etc.). I can't get in to see a psychiatrist for a couple weeks, so I'm wondering - **are there any OTC meds or short-term management options for my symptoms until I can discuss this in detail with a psychiatrist?**\n",

      "Edit: I'm open to any (reasonable) suggestions, even if you're not a med prof. I can't stress enough how distressing these symptoms are. I'm usually pretty stoic, but this is seriously causing a great deal of annoyance and frustration. These next couple of weeks are going to be downright intolerable if this gets any worse. \n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "No, I'm not aware of over the counter drugs to counter these side effects. It's very likely ziprasidone (and other antipsychotics) can cause these types of adverse effects. Contact your psychiatrist. ,The problem with that is that most drugs to treat restless legs work directly against ziprasidone (they are dopamine agonists). Gabapentin is used as well, which has a different mechanism.\n",

I started having a very sensitive ulnar nerve, which slowly resolved after changing chairs and some use of a night brace on my elbow. I still have to use the computer a lot for work though, and I still get some hand pain (and a tiny bit of forearm pain sometimes). I have had some tingling and numbness before, but it's never very prolonged. A lot of the times, the pain is focused in and around my lumbrical muscles, especially the one between my pointer and thumb. Tinel's test seems to produce a very slightly amount of tingling, but Phalen's doesn't.\n",

      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "Surgery for acoustic neuromas may involve removing all or part of the tumor. \n",
      "There are three main surgical approaches for removing an acoustic neuroma:\n",
      " Translabyrinthine, which involves making an incision behind the ear and removing the bone behind the ear and some of the middle ear. This procedure is used for tumors larger than 3 centimeters. The upside of this approach is that it allows the surgeon to see an important cranial nerve (the facial nerve) clearly before removing the tumor. The downside of this technique is that it results in permanent hearing loss. Retrosigmoid/sub-occipital, which involves exposing the back of the tumor by opening the skull near the back of the head. This approach can be used for removing tumors of any size and offers the possibility of preserving hearing. Middle fossa, which involves removing a small piece of bone above the ear canal to access and remove small tumors confined to the internal auditory canal, the narrow passageway from the brain to the middle and inner ear. Using this approach may enable surgeons to preserve a patient's hearing.\n",
