      "can physiotherapy heal diastasis recti?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "first of all congratulations for delivering a beautiful baby. i have gone through your medical history in detail. diastasis of 2. 5 cm is considered a moderate degree of diastasis as far as our classification is considered. diastasis is usually hard to heal up completely only with physiotherapy. since the defect is bony it takes lots of aggressive manouvers to get the bones back together. initial three to four weeks after delivery are the most important days if you want to get back the diastasis to normal with physiotherapy. if you have an immediate post-delivery x-ray then you can get a new x-ray done and compare the diastasis gap in both x-rays to see the progress. if it is still the same even today then there are very fewer chances that this may improve only with physiotherapy. you can use gradually compressing pelvic belt which can be tightened gradually day by day. if even this does not help then you may need surgery to get the diastasis normal. try and post an x-ray of the pelvis here so that i can guide you better. for further information consult a physiotherapist online --> <link>\n",

      "Question 2:\n",
      "can fungal infection cause low grade fever?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "this is a chronic fever which is called as pyrexia of unknown origin when we are unable to ascertain a cause. as your blood tests and x-ray are normal lung infection is ruled out. conditions causing chronic fever are numerous. also certain infections like tuberculosis hiv and malignancies can cause it. but in your case it is unlikely as there is no weight loss or other risk factors neither you have an x-ray abnormality. now we move to the lymph nodes. do you have any lymph node swelling? if yes then get it tested. try to get an ultrasound of abdomen to rule out lymphadenopathy. get a urine routine and culture as sometimes a mild urine infection can get unnoticed and cause fever. get a blood glucose and renal function test too. if everything comes normal then we should look for anemia. a low hemoglobin can cause low grade fever and fatigue. fungal infections usually cause severe illness. to confirm if it is a fungal infection a blood culture is required. for further information consult a general medicine physician online --> <link>\n",

      "Question 4:\n",
      "i am getting swelling over my face followed by toothache. why?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "the swelling that you have seems to be an abscess or pus due to infection. this infection is most likely due to your tooth decay over a long period of time which has spread to bone and around your soft tissues like muscles. in the face region swelling increases rapidly in size due to multiple natural pathways that connect each other. it is a potentially dangerous situation. the abscess needs to be drained quickly. if allowed to progress then it may lead to infection spreading to brain or even may lead to breathing difficulty. i suggest you antibiotic augmentin 625 mg twice daily along with analgesics. contact an oral surgeon or a dentist as soon as possible for physical evaluation and take the medicine with consent. follow up and get the tooth treated once infection subsides. do warm salt water rinses and apply ice to the swelling. do not apply heat as it will spread the infection further. the probable causes:tooth infection or abscess spread to vital spaces in the face. probable diagnosis:space infection due to tooth decay. treatment plan:1. abscess drainage. 2. antibiotics. 3. analgesics. 4. serratiopeptidase or other proteolytic enzymes. regarding follow up:for further information consult a dentist online. ---> <link>\n",

      "i am very concerned about my girlfriend's weight. she is 21 years old 5'5\" and 249lbs. she has gained almost 60lbs in the last two years. i also know for a fact that she was less than 140lbs when she was sixteen and this gaining seems to be way out of control. i am very worried because she seems so tired she is out of shape avoid stairs - if we have to use the stairs she is always out of breath. as i write i am very worried but i don't know what to do or how this weight will affect her. i've never been overweight myself but always heard about how difficult and harmful it is. given her recent weight gain what is the risk factors for her? if she goes to her doctor will the doctor mention her weight? because most 21 year old girls wouldn't get out of breath by just walking some stairs right.\n",

      "Melatonin induced hallucinations?I'm not sure if this would be the place that I post this, but I'm hoping someone could at least shed some light on what's happening to me/ give some advice? \n",
      "\n",
      "Some background : I've had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep since I was around 5 years old - I'm in my early twenties now. I never thought it was severe enough to qualify as a sleeping disorder, and when I was a kid it was normal for me to take 4+ hours to fall asleep. I was tired, but my mind was active and racing thoughts kept me hopelessly awake.\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple years ago when I was in high school I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety, (which definitely made me understand why my sleeping patterns were so fucked up) and depression. I got on meds (Lexapro) and that mostly helped with keeping my jumbled mind at bay when I needed to sleep. When I got to college, I was in an extremely stressful program (pulling all nighters, running on 4~ hours of sleep for a few days), so when I needed to fall asleep and be reassured that I'd get 7ish hours, I'd take about 5mg of melatonin, every night. I know that there are no long term studies on the effects of taking extra melatonin every night. I ended up building up a \"tolerance\" to it, I was taking about 25mg a night, which horrified my doctor to learn, and I immediately lowered it after my appointment. I also learned that taking antidepressants and melatonin and cause some pretty wacky nightmares, but I didn't have any unusual problems sleeping and staying asleep. And my doctor reassured me that taking 3-5mg a night isn't harmful, and that I need to do what I need to do to fall asleep. \n",
      "\n",
      "But recently (for the last 3 months or so) I was switched onto Prozac after the Lexapro stopped working, and my diagnosis was reassessed to Borderline Personality Disorder + generalized anxiety + chronic depression. The Prozac has been working really week and I don't want to die anymore (thankfully!), but I've noticed that ever since I started the meds (25mg) and taking melatonin at night (3-5mg) I've been hallucinating(??) / seeing people around my bed at night. I'm a woman and I live alone, so this is terrifying. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'll wake up in a half asleep daze and notice someone standing at the end of my bed, and their facial features are so DISTINCT! The first time this happened, I saw a bald man leaning on my bedpost, smiling at me. I promptly screamed, grabbed my pepper spray from under my pillow and sprayed it in his direction. A second later, I waved my hand through the space and realized it wasn't real. This has happened nearly every night since then, with various people appearing by my bed when I'm half asleep. \n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is that I need something to help me fall asleep at night, being depressed makes me more lethargic than the average person, so I need all the sleep I can get to function as normal human being. My stress levels have significantly decreased since dropping out of college and choosing an different path in life, but I hate falling asleep at 3am and having to wake up at 7am. But I also don't like hallucinating random people in my apartment at night when I'm alone. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have done all the recommended things for \"calming\" my mind before I sleep - No screens for 2+ hours before bedtime, sleepy time tea/lotion, reading books, working out, daydreaming, not drinking any caffeine. For people who would suggest I take Benadryl/ a similar med, antidepressants usually react badly when combined with those. \n",
      "\n",
      "Has anyone else had similar experiences when taking melatonin? Is this happening because I'm on Prozac? Is this something psychological? I never recognize the people I see at night. Any advice is greatly appreciated. \n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "I have not seen this, but have seen plenty of times where people experience very vivid, very real dreams, and sometimes violent nightmares on SSRIs like Prozac.  I am not a psychiatrist, but in collaboration with psychiatrists have utilized low doses of sedating antidepressants from a different class of medications.  Remeron/mirtazipine at 7.5 mg, 10-25 mg amitriptylline, or 50 mg trazodone at bedtime can sometimes be safely used--I think the only risk (which is low) is serotonin syndrome when adding more antidepressants.  But what I like about the philosophy is that these meds can play double duty by supporting your efforts against depression and also help you get the rest it sounds like you desperately need.  Glad to hear you are no longer suicidal.  Stay strong.\n",
