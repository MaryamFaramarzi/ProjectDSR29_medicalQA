## SUMMARY
Our goal is to built a Q&A engine that gives a detailed answer to simple health questions, like those asked every day in primary care. 

## SCOPE
• Circumstances in which physicians or pharmacists are not available.

• Circumstances in which social anxiety, shame or other barriers make communication with medical professionals impossible / difficult.

• Online pharmacies or online stores of local pharmacies that offer an additional service to their customers.

• Show healthcare professionals what AI can (and cannot).
