# ProjectDSR29_medicalQA

### SUMMARY
Our goal is to built a Q&A engine that gives a detailed answer to simple health questions –
questions like those asked every day in primary care. 

### SCOPE
• Circumstances in which physicians or pharmacists are not available.
• Circumstances in which social anxiety, shame or other barriers make communication with
  medical professionals impossible / difficult.
• Online pharmacies or online stores of local pharmacies that offer an additional service to their customers.
• Show healthcare professionals what AI can (and cannot).
